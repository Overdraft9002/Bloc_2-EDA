# Bloc 2 - Analyse exploratoire, descriptive et inférentielle de données

In Bloc_2 file :

- A "main" ipynb notebook which runs the data vilusations based on the data file from the tinder study.
- A .csv "Speed+Dating+Data", the main data file for the experimentation.
- A code book "Speed+Dating+Data+Key.doc" to understand the data.

The Bloc should be "plug and play", simply download the file and run the .ipynb notebook
